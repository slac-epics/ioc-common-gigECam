# Define these macros for network bandwidth monitoring
#   NET_IF: PV's are $CAM:$NET_IF:RX and TX
#	NET_IF_NUM: Interface number as determined by I/F order
#				in zero based output of "sar -n DEV 1 1"

# The MJPG plugin needs a unique HTTP port number
# MJPG stream viewable via http://ioc-hutch-name:$HTTP_PORT/MJPG1.mjpg
HTTP_PORT	= 8002

# Image streams
# Each image stream has it's own dedicated ROI and CC plugin
# and will in the future have some glue logic to help manage
# the port connections, automatic initialization, ROI On/Off, etc
# For now setup is still manual on first boot but is saved via autosave.
# For image viewing, we typically want a 2x2 ROI and 10hz frame rate
# for our large resolution cameras to void overloading the network or hosts.
# Example:
# ImageName, ArrayData PV,				ROI plugin prefix	ROI Port
#	IMAGE2	 $(CAM):IMAGE2:ArrayData	$(CAM):IMAGE2:ROI	IMAGE2:ROI
# Three types of streams are supported via the required NAME parameter:
#	data		Intended for data recording at up to full rate and resolution
#	viewer		Intended for viewing via edm or python viewers
#	thumbnail	Intended for small low res low frame rate image monitoring via a 130x174 edm widget 
#
# For now, data and viewer get the same plugins and differ only in
# how they are configured and used.  Later glue logic for setup and control
# will differ for these.
# Thumbnails get much the same plugins, but the ArrayData is UINT8 even for 16 bit cameras
#
# Optional Stream Parameters: (More to be added later)
#	IMAGE_NAME	Defaults to DATA1, IMAGE1, or THUMBNAIL depending on the type of stream

STREAM(NAME=viewer,IMAGE_NAME=IMAGE1)

#		ROI1, ROI2, ROI3, ROI4,
#		Stats1, Stats2, Stats3, Stats4,

#	pcdsPlugins: commonPlugins plus
#		IMAGE1, IMAGE2, THUMBNAIL
#		ROI5, ROI6, ROI7
#		MJPG1, FMPG1
# Note: pcdsPlugins is being phased out in favor of the commonPlugins
# along w/ one or more viewer or data streams

# PLUGIN can be used to add individual plugins one by one
# Must specify plugin NAME
# N defaults to 1

# If you're also using plugin sets, specify PORT or N to avoid conflicts
# The Image plugin also requires parameter IMAGE_NAME

# Not in commonPlugins
# MJPG:	Motion JPEG web stream via HTTP_PORT
# MJPG stream viewable via http://ioc-hutch-name:$HTTP_PORT/MJPG1.mjpg

# MPEG:	MPEG file I/O
# MPEG streaming not available due to lack of driver suport and high cpu overhead

# ARV_DEBUG (Only for aravisGigE cameras)
# Comma separated category:level
# Levels: 0=none, 1=warning, 2=debug, 3=log, 4=count
